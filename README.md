# Personal Portfolio Website with React

This project I intend to learn reactjs. I shall be building my personal portfolio using Reactjs in a journey to learn Reactjs. I intend to use firestore auth and NoSQl database CRUD functions to update the profile.

## Components
1. Firestore Auth to have backend access
2. NoSQL to store data
3. Tailwind for appearance
4. Server side still considering

In the process I'm learning git for version control. Wish me luck <3.
## Why ReactJS?
I'm trying to get to do remote work in a team. If you have any placement in your company kindly reach out. Otherwise, the most requirement in jobs posting is reactjs, nodejs, etc. BTW I'm equally confident in Angular 8+ projects.

## Why Firestore
It's pretty simple and easy and I'm also familiar with it. To Google consider allowing more functionality to gcp.

## Why NoSQL
I want to venture to NoSQL for simple project. Last I did for a mid-size project I found myself in SQL having wasted several weeks. So start small and simple then grow....

## Why Tailwind
It looks fun, never tried before. There's always a start of everything. I might build future admin template with it.

## Server-side
Still thinking about it perhaps nodejs

With all said and done, lets get into it.
